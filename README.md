ANSI Common Lisp - Notes and Solutions to the Exercise Questions

This is my attempt at learning Lisp. So the solutions only use the
constructs that are defined in the text upto that point.

If you see a mistake and would like to correct it, please feel free,
I'll be much obliged.

Thanks & Regards
